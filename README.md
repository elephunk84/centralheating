Iain's Central Heating Control


This central heating controller requires WiringPi and WiringPi for Python to be installed.

I use a script called at reboot by cron to start the script in a new Screen so that output is available in real time.

The schedule is held in resources/python/schedule.py

The min and max temps are set in default.py.


Future features & to do.....

- WebApp front end
- QT Gui
- Android app
