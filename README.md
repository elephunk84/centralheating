Iain's Central Heating Control


This central heating controller requires WiringPi, WiringPi for Python and RPi.GPIO to be installed.

I use a script called at reboot by cron to start the script in a new Screen so that output is available in real time.

sudo screen -r heating

command to run at reboot.

screen -d -m -S heating bash -c "sudo python /home/pi/GitRepo/centralheating/default.py"

change path to wherever you have installed it to.

The schedule is held in resources/python/schedule.py

The min and max temps are set in default.py.

It utilises 2 Raspberry PI's, one runs the Central Heating controller and the other controls the relay. 
The program includes  2 leds to display current heating status, and one button for manual override.

Future features & to do.....

- External Sensor and weather dependant programming.
- WebApp front end.
- QT Gui.
- Android app.
